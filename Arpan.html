                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Arpan . I am from Gujarat in India. I am a recent graduate of bachelors of electronics and currently, I am studying cyber security.
                    In my free time, I usually like to watch web series or movies as well as anime series, and I also like to spend time playing games on computer as well as mobile phones.
                    Most of the time nowadays, I get bored at home because I cannot explore this city in this snow, but when it melts, I would definitely try to explore Regina and the cities nearby.
