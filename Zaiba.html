                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Zaiba, and I have a deep interest in Information Technology.
                     With a strong foundation in IT, I'm always excited to explore the latest tech developments, solve problems, 
                     and expand my knowledge in this fast-paced field. Outside of my tech-driven work, 
                     I love spending time in the kitchen experimenting with new dishesâ€”cooking is a creative
                     outlet that helps me relax. I'm also an avid reader, 
                     whether it's fiction, personal growth books, or tech-related topics, 
                     I enjoy discovering new ideas and stories. During my leisure time, 
                     I like watching movies, particularly thrillers and sci-fi, 
                     which spark my imagination and provide a fun escape. 
                     I believe in maintaining a healthy balance in life, 
                     making room for my passions, and continuously growing both personally 
                     and professionally.
